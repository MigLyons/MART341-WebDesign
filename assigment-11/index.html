        <h1>Nature or Nurture: Selective Breeding for Behavioral Traits</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Hi, my name is Maddie and I’m here to talk about GMO dogs. I’m a computer science student who has done 2.5 hours of research about this topic and I
             feel I’m qualified to share what I learned. The question of whether personality traits are a result of “nature or nurture” has been a fun way to shift 
             blame for personal trait for years and years. I’ve definitely been told I was adopted for hating every ingredient of a margarita except the ice. So 
             are likes, dislikes, and attitudes the result of genes or upbringing?  Let’s look to dogs for the answer. Do you have a favorite breed of dog? I do: 
             Newfoundlands! They’re know to be giant, black or brown or a combination of the two, and enthusiastic  swimmers! They’ve been selectively bred for 
             those traits over generations of dogs, so they’re GMO dogs!

            Examples of selective breeding for physical traits are easy to find. Think about long faced Afghan hounds, sad looking basset hounds, and those phlegmy
             little pug things. These breeds have been selectively bred for their physical characteristics, resulting in vastly different body types and abilities.
            But can selective breeding affect noncorporeal characteristics like liking to swim or a hunting dog’s tracking instinct? <span class="title">[STUDY 1 NAME]</span>, a [YEAR] 
            study by [AUTHORS], suggests one way that selective breeding can affect behavior. This study compares and measured the differences in size between 
            the brains of brachycephalic dogs, shortfaced dogs like pugs, and normocephalic dogs (dogs not selectively bred for shortened faces). This study found
            that the shortening of the face leads to a measurably different neuroanatomy, or a different brain shape. The area that was most affected by this 
            change was the part of the brain that handles smells: the olfactory lobes. These lobes are smushed and shrunk by the smaller cranial cavity of short
            faced dogs. Brachycephalic dogs like pugs are known to be worse at smelling things than normocephalic dogs, and this study’s results mean that this
            deficiency could be the result of an inability to process smells like normal dogs, rather than just the result of a scrunched up nose. This is one
            way that selective breeding can affect something abstract by affecting something concrete.

        <div class="paragraph">
            But smushing the skull into a different shape isn’t the only way to affect the brain, and modifying the brain shape isn’t the only way to genetically
            affect behavior. Simply selectively breeding based on behaviors will also result in distinct “strains” of a breed with those behavior traits. <span class="title">The Canid
            genome: behavioral geneticists’ best friend?</span>, a 2012 report on the usefulness of researching dog genes to understand human genes, illnesses, and 
            behavior, notes some examples of selective breeding in laboratory settings. One example is two strains of  Arkansas Pointer Dogs, one of which was 
            bred for timidity and fear of humans. The timid strain of dogs had a measurable freeze and raising heart response to humans, as well as reduced 
            tendency to explore a new environment or to approach humans. This increased timidity was shown to be a primarily “nature” behavior, since portions
            of litters were given extra positive human interaction and, while growing less timid with humans, were not able to be “normalized”. While levels of 
            the stress hormone cortisol were normal in the timid breed, there was a distinction between the levels of the hormone insulin-like growth factor 1,
            which had lower serum concentrations than the normal, non-timid strain of dogs. IGF1 is primary associated with body size diversity in mammals, thus
            the “growth factor” part of the name, so it’s currently unclear what relationship it may have to a genetic fear response. However, these Arkansas
            Pointer scaredy cats demonstrate that personality traits can be as heritable as physical traits, and in fact may be physical traits.

            Behavior is based on reward/punishment associations – plants grow towards the sun so they get the reward of that sweet sweet radiation, I make 
            this podcast so I can get the reward of a grade, and so on. Reward and punishment are managed by neurotransmitters and corresponding receptor 
            sites in the brain. These neurotransmitters and receptors are not standardized by species: just like other parts of the body, they can vary 
            based on genes. According to <span class="title">Genetics and the behavior of domestic animals</span> written in 2013, “documentation of a relationship between genetic selection for traits, such 
            as high or low levels of fear and the number and affinity of different receptor sites, indicates that genetic selection affects brain mechanisms
            which influence behavior”. An article titled <span class="title">Genetics of Interactive Behavior in Silver Foxes</span> from 2016 documented the attempted mapping of behaviors
            to specific chromosomes in the silver fox strains raised at the Institute of Cytology and Genetics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. These silver
            foxes have been being selectively bred to form a strain of tame foxes for generations beginning in 1959, and a strain bred for aggressive behavior
            has been going since 1970. The mapping of phenotypes was not fully conclusive but does point towards 8 certain loci that may determine fox behavior,
            but is not fully conclusive.

            Isn’t it fascinating that something as abstract as how jumpy a dog is around humans can be a result of something as concrete as their genes? That means
            that the question of nature versus nurture may lean more strongly towards nature than we’ve ever thought. And according to the Canid Genome study, 
            dogs and their diseases are very close to humans and their diseases in a lot of ways. This could mean that people’s likes and dislikes are also based 
            in some way on inherited genes that affect how their brain chemistry works. Like, “aww honey, he has your nose! And your stunted dopamine receptors! 
            He’s going to be so handsome and impulsive”.
