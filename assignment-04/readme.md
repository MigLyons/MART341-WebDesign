### Explain how web browsers function
    Web browsers function by taking information about the information to be displayed, how to display it, and how to be interacted with from files in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages as well as information from .XML files and linked resources, translating, & implementing it. They do this via the internet. 
### Define and describe DOM
    DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM fits documents such as HTML and XML documents into a model(!) that programming langauges attempting to utilize the documents can easily parse. During normal web development the developer does not interact with the DOM. 
### What is the difference between HTML XML and XHTML? 
    Although HTML, XML, and XHTML all use tags to structure web pages, HTML displays document nodes while XML only describes the document nodes. XHTML combines both HTML and XML languages, upholding higher standards for longevity and accuracy of documents and consequently requiring more precision in writing. 
### What are the 4 elements your HTML pages need? 
    a !DOCTYPE declaration, which is the first element in a .html and tells the browser's processor what version type of HTML document follows.
    a root, which is the element which will contain all other elements and text in the document.
    a head, which is the element which will contain processing information and document metadata. The only essential element in the head is the <title></title> element, which gives the title of the webpage that is displayed in the browser tab of that page.
    a body, which is the element which will contain all the content and data intended for display on the document's page. 
### What is the index.html page for? Where does it go? 
    the root index.html page is the homepage of your site. It goes in the root directory of your sites directory. 
### Review: What are some of the best naming practices?
    no spaces in doc names, camelCase or underscores or dashes to make words distinct, words should either be web development standard for the type of doc you're making (e.g. about.html for an about page) or a unique description of the resource or doc to optimize finding it again, documentation, and working with other devs.
