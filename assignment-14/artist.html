            <h2>Burning Pile lyrics</h2>
            <p> All my style, all my grace <br/>
                All I tried to save my face<br/>
                All my guts, try to spill<br/>
                All my holes, try to fill<br/>
                All my money been a long time spent<br/>
                On my drugs, on my rent<br/>
                On my saving philosophy<br/>
                It goes, one in the bank and the rest for me<br/>
                It goes, all my troubles on a burning pile<br/>
                All lit up and I start to smile<br/>
                If I catch fire then I change my aim<br/>
                Throw my troubles at the pearly gates<br/>
                Oh, oh-oh-oh<br/>
                Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br/>
                (Oh-oh-oh)<br/>
                My mama, lonely maid<br/>
                Got her buns in the oven and she never got laid<br/>
                My papa, renaissance man<br/>
                Sailed away and he never came back again<br/>
                All my troubles on a burning pile<br/>
                All lit up and I start to smile<br/>
                If I catch fire then I change my aim<br/>
                Throw my troubles at the pearly gates<br/>
                Oh, oh-oh-oh<br/>
                Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh<br/>
                All your woe begones be gone<br/>
                I said all your troubles, you don't need a thing<br/>
                All my troubles on a burning pile<br/>
                All lit up and I start to smile<br/>
                If I catch fire then I'll change my aim<br/>
                Throw my troubles at the world again<br/>
                It goes, all my troubles on a burning pile<br/>
                All lit up and I start to smile<br/>
                If I, catch fire then I'll take my turn<br/>
                To burn and burn and burn<br/>
                Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba, ba, ba<br/>
                Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba, ba, ba, ba, ba<br/>
