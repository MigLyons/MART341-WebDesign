        <div class="text">
            If you're one of the wonderful people in this world who can read sheet music, count out the beats, and identify a waltz beat vs a
             swing beat vs whatever other beats there are: <b>leave my site and get off my lawn.</b><br/>
            For the rest of us: here's a quick summary of what the above people mean when they say "swing beat". 
        </div>
        <br/>
        <div class="text">
            Music with a swing beat is music where the second and fourth beats in a 4/4 measure played in 8th notes are "swung", which means slightly delayed.*
            This means that instead of nice uniform <span>beat beat beat beat</span> the measure sounds more like <span>beat be-beat beat 
            be-beat</span>&#8224. Music people will try to count out <span>one and-a-two three and-a-four</span>. It's fun to 
            let them explain once or twice, but once you get past the 20 minute mark both you and the music person will become distressed.

                <li>*This is a very simple explanation of a revolutionary technique which has been attempted by many and mastered
                    by few. Don't @ me.</li>
                <li>&#8224 I would render this for you in music notes, but swing beat is not written differently than straight beat. You just have to 
                    feel the difference.&#8225</li>
                <li>
                    &#8225 This is why I only dance with people more musical than myself, so they can feel the beat and I can feel their cues.</li>
